# CognitiveServices-Demo-TextAnalytics
Windows 10 sample app written in C# for UWP that calls into the [Text Analytics API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api) of Microsoft [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) to assess the positive sentiment, key phrases and language of a body of text.

## Implementation Notes
* The current version extracts the sentiment score and the key phrases, but not the language detection (yet).
